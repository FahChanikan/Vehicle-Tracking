# Vehicle Tracking and Speed Estimation using OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project is developed as an **OpenCV-based computer vision assignment**.  
It focuses on **vehicle tracking and speed estimation from a video source** using perspective transformation and video processing techniques.

The system processes a road traffic video, tracks vehicle movement, and estimates speed based on transformed coordinates in a real-world plane.
